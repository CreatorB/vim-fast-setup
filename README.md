# üíª Vim Fast Setup

üñºÔ∏è _"Although I love Linux, my workplace uses Windows, so I use WSL to run Kali Linux"_

This repository provides a quick and easy way to set up a powerful Vim environment with pre-configured settings. For seasoned Vim users, this setup will help you get up and running with a highly productive Vim configuration in no time. Perhaps you have different preferences and settings, you may need to adjust the rest.

**NOTE:** You can skip the *Quick Start* steps by automating them with the `setup.sh` script provided in this repository:

```
cd ~ ; git clone git@github.com:CreatorB/vim-fast-setup.git ; cd vim-fast-setup ; chmod +x setup.sh ; ./setup.sh
```

Also you will need to add the following lines to your .gitignore file when using this VIM in your project:

```
CoffeeScript
Enable
Files
JavaScript
Misc
Shell
Status
VIM
Visual
bufExplorer
vimgrep
solid
```
